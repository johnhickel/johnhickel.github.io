        <p class="about-text">I am a 23 year old aspiring programmer who has learnt html, css, javascript, and python. I continue to learn more languages and refine my knowledge of the languages I have practiced. During my last year at the University of Florida I realized my love for coding and began to learn on my own while graduating with a Bachelor's degree in Sociology. Since then I have been building my own projects and teaching my self using resources online. By doing so I have gained certifications and a greater knowledge of programming.</p>

        <p class="about-text">I graduated from the University of Florida in December of 2022 with a Bachelor's Degree in Sociology. I hope to pair this with my knowledge in coding to find a job within a social media or gaming company to better help the organization apply their programs to society as a whole.</p>
