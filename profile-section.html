        <p class="about-text">I am an aspiring programmer who has learnt html, css, javascript, and python. I continue to learn more languages and refine my knowledge of thelanguages I have practiced. During my last year at the University of Florida I realized my love for coding and began to learn on my own while graduating with a Bachelor's degree in Sociology. Since then I have been building my own projects and teaching my self using resources online. By doing so I have gained certifications and a greater knowledge of programming.</p>
