        <p class="intro-para">Teamfight Tactics is an auto battler game developed and published by Riot Games. The game is a spinoff of League of Legends and is based on Dota Auto Chess, where players compete online against seven other opponents by building a team to be the last one standing. There are also multiple modes of the game which include: Normal, Ranked, HyperRoll and the most recent release, Double Up. While most of these modes are against seven other opponents, Double Up is a special game mode where players have a partner and the team plays against six other players who make up the three other teams. The game released as a League of Legends game mode for Microsoft Windows and macOS in June 2019 and as a standalone game for Android and iOS in March 2020, featuring cross-platform play between them.</p>

        <p class="p2">Little Legends</p>
        <p class="p3">A little legend is the character that a player controls. By right-clicking on the screen, you can direct your little legend to move to that position. This is used to pick up units on the carousel and to pick up gold, items, or units from orbs.</p>
        <p class="p2">Buying Units</p>
        <p class="p3">The shop can be found at the bottom of the screen and displays 5 units that can be bought. This shop will update after every round (can be seen at the top of the screen) or can be refreshed at the cost of two gold. The units can be clicked on to be bought or clicked and dragged towards the playing field to be purchased.</p>
        <p class="p2">Selling Units</p>
        <p class="p3">Opposite of buying units, selling units can be accomplished by clicking on a unit you own and dragging it over the shop where it will tell you how much gold the unit is worth. Units sell for the same value they were intially bought for unless they have been combined. (see <a class="p3a" href="#Units">Units</a> section)</p>
        <p class="p2">Experience and Levels</p>
        <p class="p3">Everyone starts the game at Level 1 with 0 xp and as they increase levels they can field the same amount of units as their level (Level 1 = 1 unit, Level 9 = 9 units). After each round you gain 2 xp and 4 xp can also be bought in the left side of the shop at a cost of 4 gold. A player can buy as much xp as they like as long as they have the gold to afford it. Each level requires increasing amounts of xp in order to level up and the maximum level is Level 9. With the augment Level Up a player can reach Level 10 Going from Level 1 to Level 2 happens after the first round and can not be purchased by buying xp. The other levels can be seen in the following chart:</p>
        <table>
