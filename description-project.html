        <p class="intro-para">Teamfight Tactics is an auto battler game developed and published by Riot Games. The game is a spinoff of League of Legends and is based on Dota Auto Chess, where players compete online against seven other opponents by building a team to be the last one standing. There are also multiple modes of the game which include: Normal, Ranked, HyperRoll and the most recent release, Double Up. While most of these modes are against seven other opponents, Double Up is a special game mode where players have a partner and the team plays against six other players who make up the three other teams. The game released as a League of Legends game mode for Microsoft Windows and macOS in June 2019 and as a standalone game for Android and iOS in March 2020, featuring cross-platform play between them.</p>

        <p class="p2">Little Legends</p>
        <p class="p3">A little legend, also known as a Tactician, is the character that a player controls. By right-clicking on the screen, you can direct your little legend to move to that position. This is used to pick up units on the carousel and to pick up gold, items, or units from orbs. Every little legend starts the game with 100 health and loses health by losing fights with other players or by losing to neutrals (PvE rounds that drop gold and items). Once a little legends health hits 0 they are out of the game and they can no longer be battled in PvP rounds. In order to win the game a player must be the last of the 8 little legends to survive.</p>
        <p class="p2">Stages</p>
        <p class="p3">A stage is a collection of rounds and contains 3 types of gameplay (Stage 1 only has 2 types) that can be classified as Carousel, PvE (player vs environment, aka neutrals or neutral rounds), and PvP (player vs player, aka combat rounds). Stage 1 is the only differing stage as it consists only of a carousel round to start the game followed by 3 PvE rounds. After this the stages will follow a pattern of 3 PvP rounds, a carousel round, 2 more PvP rounds, and then a PvE round to end the stage. The stages patterns can be seen in the following chart displaying stages 1-6 (about the length of a regular game):</p>

        <p class="p2">Carousel</p>
        <p class="p3">The carousel is a circular field in which units, and items attached to these units, are picked by players using their little legends. This happens at the start of the game and in the middle of every stage (1-1, 2-4, 3-4, 4-4, 5-4, etc.). On the first carousel every player has equal chances to get the unit they want and gain the unit by walking through them with their little legends. On every following carousel the players with the two lowest player healths are allowed to pick first starting on opposite sides of the carousel. The next two lowest health players are released after a delay and this continues until there are no remaning players.</p>
        <p class="p2">The Shop</p>
        <p class="p3">The shop is found at the bottom of the player's screen and is used in 4 main ways: buying xp, buying units, refreshing the shop, and selling units. It also displays other useful information such as the gold that can be earned each round (top middle of the shop) and the chances of getting units that are worth different amounts (top left of the shop). It also has a lock icon at the top right that can be enabled to stop the shop from refreshing at the end of the round (this must be reenabled every round to retain current shop). The shop can be refreshed at the cost of 2 gold and presents 5 new units that can then be purchased. This can be done an unlimited amount of times as long as you have the gold to purchase the refresh.</p>
        <p class="p2">Buying Units</p>
        <p class="p3">The shop displays 5 units that can be bought. This shop will update after every round (can be seen at the top of the screen) or can be refreshed at the cost of two gold. The units can be clicked on to be bought or clicked and dragged towards the playing field to be purchased.</p>
        <p class="p2">Selling Units</p>
        <p class="p3">Opposite of buying units, selling units can be accomplished by clicking on a unit you own and dragging it over the shop where it will tell you how much gold the unit is worth. Units sell for the same value they were intially bought for unless they have been combined. (see <a class="p3a" href="#Units">Units</a> section)</p>
        <p class="p2">Experience and Levels</p>
        <p class="p3">Everyone starts the game at Level 1 with 0 xp and as they increase levels they can field the same amount of units as their level (Level 1 = 1 unit, Level 9 = 9 units). After each round you gain 2 xp and 4 xp can also be bought in the left side of the shop at a cost of 4 gold. A player can buy as much xp as they like as long as they have the gold to afford it. Each level requires increasing amounts of xp in order to level up and the maximum level is Level 9. With the augment Level Up a player can reach Level 10 Going from Level 1 to Level 2 happens after the first round and can not be purchased by buying xp. The other levels can be seen in the following chart:</p>

        <p class="p2">Gold</p>
        <p class="p3">Gold is the currency in game that allows players to take actions such as buying units or xp and refreshing the shop during a round. Gold can be earned in a number of ways. The most basic way to earn gold is through base income which is given at the start of every round and is always 5 gold (Round 1-2 gives 2 gold followed by 2 gold, 3 gold, and 4 gold in subsequent rounds, afterwards base gold income is always 5 gold). The other main ways gold can be earned is from winning a PvP round, gold interest, win/loss streaks, and orbs. Winning a PvP round always provides 1 gold immediately upon winning the fight. Gold interest is calculated based on how much gold a player has (displayed at the top middle of the shop). Here is a chart of the gold interest: </p>

        <p class="p3">With certain augments, gold interest can be locked to a set number, removed entirely, or extrapolated to 70+ gold granting 7 gold interest. Win/Loss streaks also give gold at the start of the following round based on the following chart:</p>

        </table>
        <p class="p3">Orbs can give gold directly or units that can be sold for gold. Gold can also be earned through special effects such as augments, units that give gold, and traits. These special effects can change from Set to Set.</p>
        <p class="p2">Orbs</p>
        <p class="p3">Orbs are gained by defeating monsters during PvE rounds or by augments and some traits. Orbs are divided into 3 types: grey, blue, and gold. Grey orbs give small amounts of gold and low cost units. Blue orbs give item components, more gold, or mid cost units and in later stages can give full itmes. Gold orbs give golden spatulas (see <a class="p3a" href="#Items">Items</a> section), high cost units, or large amounts of gold. </p>
        <p class="p2">Positioning</p>
        <p class="p3">Positioning is the way in which a player places their units on the playing field. The standard idea is that tank units are placed on the frontline and take enemy aggro first while damage units that have less health and resistances are placed towards the backline. Depending on meta, patches, and unique traits (such as Hacker or Assassin) positioning can differ in some ways.</p>
        <p class="p2">Placement</p>
        <p class="p3">A players placement in a match of TFT is based first on the round in which their little legend ends with 0 or less health and then is decided by how far below 0 health they ended that round. If two players go to or below 0 health during the same round the one who is further below 0 takes the lower position. In this way the placement of players from 8th to 1st is decided throughout the game. Players that go to or below 0 health in the same round and ended with the same number (such as -7 health and -7 health) have their placement decided randomly.</p>
        <p class="p2">Damage & Resistances</p>
        <p class="p3">Damage from units comes in three forms AD (attack damage), AP (ability power), and true damage. Attack damage is generally caused by auto attacks from units and can critical strike based on crit chance. Ability power generally comes from abilities that units use after a set amount of attacks or after filling up their mana bar. Armor and Magic Resistance protect the unit from a percentage of incoming damage. Armor protects against attack damage and magic resistance protects against ability power. True damage is a special type of damage that ignores resistances.</p>
        <p class="p2">Shielding & Healing</p>
        <p class="p3">Shielding is very similar to a units hp but is seen as a grey bar next to hp. Shielding is always reduced first on a unit and acts as a type of bonus hp that can not be recovered with healing. Healing is an effect that adds hp back to a units health bar but can not recover shielding and can not exceed the units maximum hp that it starts with in a round. If both healing and shielding are in effect at the same time, the unit will heal hp if it is missing health while the shield tanks the damage.</p>
