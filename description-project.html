        <p class="intro-para">Teamfight Tactics is an auto battler game developed and published by Riot Games. The game is a spinoff of League of Legends and is based on Dota Auto Chess, where players compete online against seven other opponents by building a team to be the last one standing. There are also multiple modes of the game which include: Normal, Ranked, HyperRoll and the most recent release, Double Up. While most of these modes are against seven other opponents, Double Up is a special game mode where players have a partner and the team plays against six other players who make up the three other teams. The game released as a League of Legends game mode for Microsoft Windows and macOS in June 2019 and as a standalone game for Android and iOS in March 2020, featuring cross-platform play between them.</p>

        <p class="p2">Buying Units</p>
        <p class="p3">The shop can be found at the bottom of the screen and displays 5 units that can be bought. This shop will update after every round (can be seen at the top of the screen) or can be refreshed at the cost of two gold. The units can be clicked on to be bought or clicked and dragged towards the playing field to be purchased. </p>
        <p class="p2">Selling Units</p>
        <p class="p3">Opposite of buying units, selling units can be accomplished by clicking on a unit you own and dragging it over the shop where it will tell you how much gold the unit is worth. Units sell for the same value they were intially bought for unless they have been combined. (see <a class="p3a" href="#Units">Units</a> section)</p>
